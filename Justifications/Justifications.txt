String vs Int

The advantages of using int as datatype is that it takes up 4 bytes to save an integer value.
While for a String type it would be a little more since it is Total size = (number of bits to encode a char * number of char) / 8
So a string "12345678910" when encoded in ASCII would take (11*8)/8 = 11 bytes 

So this is why I chose the student ID to be saved as int datatype.

firstName, lastName vs givenName, familyName

In some countries people provide their 'surname' as 'firstName' so it is better to ask 'givenName' and 'familyName' to make it
explicitly clear.

Array vs ArrayList

Arrays in Java are of fixed size, while the ArrayList are dynamic sized. Since in the implenetations we are dealing with
University students there exists no fixed size. So I opted the ArrayList implementation
