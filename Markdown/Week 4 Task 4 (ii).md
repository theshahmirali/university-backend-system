# Markdown for Week 4 Tasks 4 (ii)

Firstly I added new methods in the AssessmentScheme class where we can now
addAssessments, getAssessment and know the if the assessment has been completed
or not.

Next in the Unit class I now created an AssessmentScheme object. Then I
created a method completedAll to check if the student has completed the assessments.
Then a method is made to calculate the total marks for an assignment according to
the task specs. 

Next to check if everything is working I made an Exam object along with an assignment,
here I added marks for two students who are enrolled into that unit.
Everything compiled perfectly.
